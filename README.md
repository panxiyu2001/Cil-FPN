# Cil-FPN: A New Paradigm for Efficient Feature Fusion for Remote Sensing Target Detection

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for the paper  
**"Cil-FPN: A New Paradigm for Efficient Feature Fusion for Remote Sensing Target Detection"**.  
It introduces the **Cross-layer Lightweight Feature Pyramid Network (Cil-FPN)** for remote sensing object detection.

## Abstract

Remote sensing object detection faces persistent challenges from small objects, dense distributions, and complex backgrounds. Conventional detectors tend to lose fine-grained spatial cues due to repeated down-sampling, limiting small-object perception.  
To address this, we introduce the **Cross-layer Lightweight Feature Pyramid Network (Cil-FPN)**, which enhances detection by combining shallow high-resolution features with deep semantic cues. Within Cil-FPN, the **Multibranch Competitive Frequency-guided Module (MCFM)** further improves discriminative representation.

## Contributions

- Propose **Cil-FPN**, a lightweight cross-layer feature pyramid network tailored for remote sensing detection.  
- Introduce **MCFM**, integrating global context pooling with frequency-domain edge enhancement.  
- Achieve superior performance on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficiency.
